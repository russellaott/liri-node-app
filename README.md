Liri Node App:

This app is an intro to using node.js and javascript for to take in commands in an environment other than the browser. 

It runs based off 4 commands:

my-tweets

spotify-this-song

movie-this

do-what-it-says

The first command will find or fetch my last 20 tweets

The second command takes in a song title and returns information relevant to that song. 

The third command takes in a movie title and returns information relevant to that song. 

The fourth command will do any of the above 3 but it will take text from our random.txt file and run the song through our "spotify-this-song" command
